# Horiseon Sample

## Description

```
The motivation is to create a mock up of a webpage that represent Horiseon that would follow the accessibility standards and optimized for search engines for the company Horiseon.
```

```
I build this project to make it easy for accessbility for those who need to access the Horiseon website.
```

```
The problems solved would be ease of access for people who needs accessbility to Horiseon's website.
```

```
I learned that there are semantic and non-semantic tags to a modern webpage and their structure doesn't use the div tags.
```

## Changes

```
Changes includes changing most "div" tags into semantic tags such as "header", "nav", "content", and "aside". Changing the "div" tag that is the child to the "header" tag break the structure of the webpage. There is a change in the CSS file which is changing the "div" tags into nav make the webpage to its original appearance.
